### Please Read the Following Instruction to Get Started ###

This repository is made to run the Bs/B+ analysis using CMS 2018 PbPb 5.02 TeV datasets. If you successfully run the codes, you should be able to get Bs/B+ as a function pT and event centrality

Some rename of the codes may need to be done since some of the codes' names are a little weird. Nonetheless, for the moment, let's stick to the names now and see if we can get the analysis done on the B mesons done.  

## To START ##

To start, first find a fresh folder on your local machine

Then get this repository first download it from github by doing:

git clone https://github.com/MYOMAO/BsBpPbPb2018.git

You will see the following two folders:

BsAna BpAna

Basically, they stands for the Bs part and the B+ part of the analysis codes. They will get you the cross sections.
